# Diabetes Prediction
Management of hyperglycemia (refers to high levels of sugar, or glucose, in the blood) in hospitalized patients has a significant bearing on outcome, in terms of both morbidity and mortality. However, there are few national assessments of diabetes care during hospitalization which could serve as a baseline for change. This analysis of a large clinical database was undertaken to provide such an assessment and to find future directions which might lead to improvements in patient safety.

Based on the given data, build a model to predict whether the patient is suffering from Diabetes or not?
